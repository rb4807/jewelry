As for backend development, I utilized Django Framework, and for database management, I utilized PostgreSQL. For further reference and access, please visit my GitHub repository.

<p align="right">After the user has been verified and logged in, they will be granted access to add items to their cart. Failure to do so will result in being redirected to the login page. The implemented functionality enables the user to easily add products to their cart, while also providing the option to specify the desired quantity. Furthermore, if the user no longer needs a particular product, they can effortlessly remove it from their cart.</p>

<h1 align="center">💳 Payment Integration</h1>
<p align="center">After selecting products, customers have the option to proceed with an order by furnishing their delivery address. The payment can be executed through a range of methods, including debit/credit card, online payment, pay later, or cash on delivery. Upon successful completion of the payment, an invoice bill will be automatically generated, which can be downloaded in PDF format. The invoice bill encompasses essential personal information, such as the name and contact number of the individual who placed the order, as well as the delivery address. Additionally, it includes comprehensive order details, such as the product name, quantity, sub total, tax, and the total amount, inclusive of tax.</p>

<h1 align="center">🗓 Staff Appointments</h1>
<p align="center">Same as add to cart if user is verified and logged in will only grant access to appointments else it will redirect to login page. A time-saving feature has been implemented to enhance customer experience by offering appointments. Customers are now able to schedule appointments with our staff on their preferred day to receive shopping assistance and more. Additionally, customers have the flexibility to cancel their appointments if necessary.</p>

<h1 align="center">📩 Contact Us</h1>
