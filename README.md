After the user has been verified and logged in, they will be granted access to add items to their cart. Failure to do so will result in being redirected to the login page. The implemented functionality enables the user to easily add products to their cart, while also providing the option to specify the desired quantity. Furthermore, if the user no longer needs a particular product, they can effortlessly remove it from their cart.

After selecting products, customers have the option to proceed with an order by furnishing their delivery address. The payment can be executed through a range of methods, including debit/credit card, online payment, pay later, or cash on delivery. Upon successful completion of the payment, an invoice bill will be automatically generated, which can be downloaded in PDF format. The invoice bill encompasses essential personal information, such as the name and contact number of the individual who placed the order, as well as the delivery address. Additionally, it includes comprehensive order details, such as the product name, quantity, sub total, tax, and the total amount, inclusive of tax.

A time-saving feature has been implemented to enhance customer experience by offering appointments. Customers are now able to schedule appointments with our staff on their preferred day to receive shopping assistance and more. Additionally, customers have the flexibility to cancel their appointments if necessary.

Customers have the option to peruse the review and feedback provided by other users. However, in order to contribute their own feedback and recommendations, users must be logged in. This will grant them the capability to submit written reviews and include photos if desired. By utilizing the "view comments" feature, customers can exclusively view their own comments. Furthermore, customers possess the ability to make necessary modifications or delete their posts, which falls within the category of CRUD operations.
